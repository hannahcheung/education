# Computer Science for Everyone

This project is a web app that fulfills "Quality Education" of the UN's
Sustainable Development Goals, and specifically allowing people with
experience with programming/computer science to find local nonprofits which
work in increasing equity in computer science education. Once those nonprofits
are found, the user can visit the nonprofit website and find volunteering,
teaching, or donation opportunities.

# Home

The Home page provides the title of the site and navigation to the
"About" portion of the page.

TO DO: Add icons in background, refine style of button, change colors of
background and other elements, convert to Chakra UI

# About

The About page will provide context and a data visualization as to why
increasing equity in computer science education matters; underrepresented
minorities are much less likely to study computer science and are more
likely to drop out of STEM programs due to imposter syndrome.

TO DO: Do research and add data visualization

# Locations

The Locations page provides a United States map which marks all the
local computer science education organizations. Upon a hover, it lists
the name of the organization and a link to the organization, as well
as a description.

TO DO: Add zoom in button feature for map, hook up input to lat-long API,
edit tooltip to include more info (description, make a link)
